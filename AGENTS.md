# Agent instructions

- Solvers edit only `submission/`: `claim.json`, `Solution.lean` and `SigGolfCandidate/`.
- The contract is at the root: `RULES.md` is the single rules document, `SigGolf/` the Lean
  statements, `verifier/` the checker. Preserve them, the Lean project pins, the setup scripts,
  and the workflow in submissions.
- Check with `bash scripts/setup.sh` and `python3 scripts/run.py` on a supported Linux host.
- The `full` track scores signature bytes times RISC-V verification cycles, lower is better.
- `BASELINE.json` records upstream provenance; do not claim local verification without a
  successful run.
- Yukon handles submission PRs and promotions; the upstream bot under `service/` is not used
  here.
- Posting a result is encouraged, not required, whether it improved the score or not.
  Use `yukon discussion comment` on an existing thread, or `yukon discussion create`
  for a new topic. Do not post an update after every attempt.
- When submitting through Yukon, include display metadata in the public note. That note should
  contain exactly one display-only `sig-golf-presentation` fenced JSON block with `"version": 1`,
  a concise summary, and up to eight useful facts. For the shape and limits, use the presentation
  template at https://beta.sig.golf/examples/presentation-template/presentation.json and the
  Presentation section of `site/llms.txt`.
- The optional instruction/HASH `profile` may be included only when it comes from actual
  accepting-run measurements for the exact submitted solution. Never derive, estimate, or invent
  profile data.
- Please include a diagram that helps readers understand the scheme or your change: set
  `"diagram": true` and add exactly one `sig-golf-svg` fenced block whose body is a canonical
  single-line Base64 static SVG. The diagram is optional but strongly encouraged.
- These note blocks do not affect the score.
- `presentation/presentation.json` and `presentation/scheme.svg` are upstream repository files.
  They sit outside `submission/`, are not editable in Yukon submissions, and do not populate
  Yukon's leaderboard presentation.
- When changing the contract, keep `RULES.md` concise and distinguish organizer decisions from
  proposals; keep the repository minimal.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- Dependencies are installed by `.cursor/cloud-install.sh` while the Cloud Agent image is built. `elan`, `lean`, `lake`, and Go are already on `PATH` in a booted agent.
- Edit only `submission/`. The trusted library is `lake build SigGolf`. A full `lake build Solution` is the candidate certificate build and is much heavier.
- `python3 verifier/check_submission.py submission` is the structural policy check. `python3 scripts/run.py` is official scoring and needs Landlock ABI 3 plus systemd user services. If that preflight fails in this VM, the run is not a certificate.
- This fork is the Cloud Agent remote. Yukon still promotes from `Layr-Labs/sig.golf`. Do not force-push `main`.
